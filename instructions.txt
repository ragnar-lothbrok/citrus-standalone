Solution1:

MainClass.java contains main method to see output we have to run this file.

Static Files : 
CSV File : Temp_Data.csv
XML File : temp.xml

Can be done[Enhancement] :
1. We can also use Open CSV for parsing CSV file.
2. We can parse file at every time when method is called but as all 4 operations need to be done at once so
   I parsed both the files only once and then started performing operations.
3. We can also take file names using command line arguments or scanner.
